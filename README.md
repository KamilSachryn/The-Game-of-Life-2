# The Game of Life

A GUI project based on Conway's Game of Life, is a cellular automaton which attempts to simulate cells in a closed enviroment. It is composed of only a few rules and will always play out in the same way given the same starting conditions. 

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
### Installation

Compilation requires 

 - `Visual Studio`
 - `C#.net`

### Usage

A game can be set up by clicking on the GUI, placing a cell per click or by dragging the mouse, placing either lines of cells with the left mouse button, or a rectangle of squares with the right click.

Once a board is set you can either Tick the simulation by one step, or begin a loop to automatically move the simulation forward.
